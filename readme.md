# MasterThemes

A tooling infrastructure for building color themes.

## Overview

A set of tooling for building color themes and producing settings for a wide array of products from
terminals, editors, IDE's, to nearly any theme-able application.

In short, one master theme (hence the name) allows output for dozens of applications.

## Inspiration

MasterThemes was heavily inspired by [Base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/), for more
details please read [Inspiration](inspiration.md).

## Documentation

MasterThemes is designed in a two-layered file mapping system. First, you have the master color
theme (master theme or just theme for short) which houses the mappings between identifiable themed
slots (like "constant" or "comment") and the desired style of that item. Second, you have
application templates that map any number of those identifiable themed slots to a particular
applications theme format and identifiers. Master themes are intended to be used across different
application templates, and application templates are intended to be able to consume any master
theme.

Finally, a builder is a tool that can be used to combine a theme or themes with a template or
templates to produce the necessary output that can then be used with the desired application(s).
